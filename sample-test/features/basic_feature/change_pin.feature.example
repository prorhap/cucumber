Feature: Change PIN
  
  Customers being issued new cards are supplied with a Personal
  Identification Number (PIN) that is randomly generated by the
  system.

  In order to be able to change it to something they can easily
  remember, customers with new bank cards need to be able to
  change their PIN using the ATM.

  	Background: Insert a newly issued card and sign in
    	Whenever the bank issues new cards to customers, they are supplied
    	with a Personal Identification Number (PIN) that is randomly
    	generated by the system.

		Given I have been issued a new card
		And I insert the card, entering the correct PIN
		When I choose "Change PIN" from the menu
	

	Scenario: Change PIN successfully
		And I change the PIN to 9876
		Then the system should remember my PIN is now 9876

	Scenario: Try to change PIN to the same as before Given I have been issued a new card
		Then I should see a warning message
		And the system should not have changed my PIN
